            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I treated there with a number of Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords and Gentlemen, and treated honeſtly and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, I cannot ſay but they did very nobly with me, we were upon a concluſion of the Treaty. Now I would know by what Authority, I mean, lawful; there are many unlawful Authorities in the world, Theeves and Robbers by the high ways; but I would know by what Authority I was brought from thence, and carryed from place to place, (and I know not what) and when I know what lawful Authority, I ſhal anſwer, Remember I am your King, your lawful King, and what ſins you bring upon your heads, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon this Land, think well upon it, I ſay, think well upon it, before you go further from one ſin to a greater, therefore let me know by what lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I am ſeated here, and I ſhall not be unwilling to anſwer; in the mean time I ſhall not betray my Truſt; I have a Truſt committed to me by God, by old and lawful deſcent, I will not betray it to anſwer to a new unlawful Authority, therefore reſolve me that, and you ſhall hear more of me.</p>

I ſee no Houſe of Lords here that may conſtitute a Parliament, and (the King too) ſhould have been. Is this the bringing of the King to his Parliament? Is this the bringing an end to the Treaty in the publique faith of the world? Let me

               <p>Sir, I deſire that you would give me, and all the world, ſatisfaction in this; let me tell you, it is not a ſlight thing you are about. I am ſworn to keep the Peace by that duty I owe to GOD and my Country, and I will do it to the laſt breath of my body, and therefore you ſhall do well to ſatisfie firſt GOD, and then the Country, by what Authority you do it, if you do it by a uſurped Authority, you cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. There is a GOD in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you power, to account; Satisfie me in that, and I will anſwer, otherwiſe I betray my Truſt, and the Liberties of the People, and therefore think of that, and then I ſhall be willing. For I do avow, That it is a great ſin to withſtand lawful Authority, as it is to ſubmit to a Tyrannical, or any other ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawful Authority, and therefore ſatisfie me that, and you ſhall receive my anſwer.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, my Lord Preſident,</p>
                  <p>I did at the laſt Court in the behalf of the Commons of England, exhibit and give into this Court a Charge of high Treaſon, and other high Crimes againſt the Priſoner at the Barre, whereof I do accuſe him in the name of the People of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the Charge was read unto him, and his Anſwer required. My Lord, He was not then dleaſed to give an Anſwer, but inſtead of anſwering, did there diſpute the authority of this high Court. My humble Motion to this high Court in behalf of the Kingdom of England is, That the Priſoner may be directed to make a poſtive Anſwer, either by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:164884:6"/>
way of Confeſſion, or Negation; which if he ſhall refuſe to do, That the matter of Charge may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and the Court may proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to juſtice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You may remember at the laſt Court you were told the occaſion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you containing a charge of high Treaſon and other high crimes againſt this Realme of England; you heard likewiſe, that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ſhould give an Anſwer to that Charge, that thereupon ſuch proceedings might be had as ſhould be agreeable to juſtice; you were then pleaſed to make ſome ſcruples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of this Court, and knew not not by what authority you were brought hither; you did divers times propound your Queſtions, and were as often anſwer'd, That it was by authority of the <hi>Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> that did think fit to call you to Account for thoſe high and capitall Miſdemeanours wherewith you were then charg'd. Since that the Court hath taken into Conſideration what you then ſaid, they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with their owne authority, and they hold it fit you ſhould ſtand ſatisfied with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a poſitive and particular anſwer to this charge that is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt you; they do expect you ſhould either confeſſe or deny it; if you deny, it is offer'd in the behalfe of the Kingdome to be made good againſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:164884:6"/>
you; their authority they do avow to the whole world, that the whole Kingdome are to reſt ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and you are to reſt ſatisfied with it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are to loſe no more time, but to give a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive anſwer thereunto.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>
                  <p>When I was here laſt, 'tis very true, I made that Queſtion, and truly if it were onely my owne particular caſe, I would have ſatisfied my ſelfe with the Proteſtation I made the laſt time I was here againſt the legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be tryed by any Superiour Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on Earth; but it is not my caſe alone, it is the freedome and the liberty of the People of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and do you pretend what you will, I ſtand more for their Liberties. For if Power without Law may make Lawes, may alter the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, I do not know what ſubject he is in England, that can be ſure of his life or any thing that he calls his owne; therefore when that I came here, I did expect particular reaſons to know by what Law, what Authority you did proceed againſt me here, and therefore I am a little to ſeek what to ſay to you in this particular, becauſe the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is to be prov'd, the Negative often is very hard to do: but ſince I cannot perſwade you to do it, I ſhall tell you my Reaſons as ſhort as I can.</p>
                  <p>My Reaſons why in Conſcience and the duty I owe to God firſt, and my People next, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their lives, Liberties and Eſtates; I conceive I cannot anſwer this, till I be ſatisfied of the legality of it.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you, which I would not do, but that what you doe is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the proceedings of any Court of Juſtice, you are about to enter into Argument, and diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authority of this Court, before whom you appear as a priſoner, and are charged as an high Delinquent; if you take upon you to diſpute the Authority of the Court we may not do it, nor will any Court give way unto it, you are to ſubmit unto it, you are to give a punctuall and direct anſwer, whether you will anſwer your Charge or no, and what your anſwer is.</p>

                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, by your favour, I doe not know the forms of Law, I doe know Law and Reaſon, though I am no Lawyer profeſs'd, but I know as much Law as any Gentleman in England; and therefore (under favour) I do plead for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people of England more then you doe, and therefore if I ſhould impoſe a beliefe upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man without reaſons given for it, it were unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but I muſt tell you, that that reaſon that I have as thus informed I cannot yeeld unto it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you, you may not be permitted, you ſpeak of Law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is fit there ſhould be Law and reaſon, and there is both againſt you. Sir, the Vote of the Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament, it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:164884:7"/>
the reaſon of the Kingdome, and they are theſe that have given to that Law, according to which you ſhould have rulid and reigned: Sir, you are not to diſpute our Authority, you are told it again by the Court. Sir, it will be taken notice of, that you ſtand in contempt of the Court, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt will be recorded accordingly.</p>

                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>
                  <p>I doe not know how a King can be a Delinquent, but by any Law that ever I heard of, all men (Delinquents or what you will) let me tell you they may put in Demurrers againſt any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as legall, and I doe demand that, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be heard with my Reaſons, if you deny that, you deny Reaſon.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you have offer'd ſomething to the Court, I ſhall ſpeak ſomthing unto you the ſence of the Court. Sir, neither you nor any man are permitted to diſpute that point, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, you may not demurre the Juriſdiction of the Court, if you do, I muſt let you know, that they over-rule your Demurrer, they ſit here by the Authority of the Commons of England, and all your Predeceſſors, and you are reſponſible to them.</p>

                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>

                  <p>Sir, you ought not to interrupt while the Court is ſpeaking to you, this point is not to be debated by you, neither will the Court per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:164884:8"/>
you to do it, if you offer it by way of Demurrer to the Juriſdiction of the Court, they have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their Juriſdiction, they do affir me their owne Juriſdiction.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>The King.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay Sir, by your favor, that the Commons of England was never a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, I would know how they came to be ſo.</p>
